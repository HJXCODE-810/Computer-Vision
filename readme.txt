TOPIC: FACE DETECTION USING A PICTURE AND REAL TIME DETECTION

1)FACE DETECTION USING A PICTURE AS SAMPLE OF " ROBERT DOWNEY JR. "

PREREQUISITE

WE NEED TO IMPORT THE LIBRARY NAMED "OPENCV" IN PYTHON PROGRAMMING USED IN THIS PROJECT.
THIS README PROVIDES A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF HOW TO PERFORM FACE DETECTION USING OPENCV IN PYTHON. FACE DETECTION IS A FUNDAMENTAL TASK IN COMPUTER VISION THAT INVOLVES IDENTIFYING AND LOCATING HUMAN FACES WITHIN AN IMAGE OR VIDEO STREAM
YOU CAN INSTALL OPENCV AND NUMPY USING PIP, A PYTHON PACKAGE MANAGER
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy
1>  IMPORT THE LIBRARY CALLED cv2

2>NEXT WE WILL READ THE IMAGE INTO A FORM OF MATRIX CALLED imread BY PASSING THE PATH OF DESIRED IMAGE AND SHOWN IT USING imshow.

3>THE GIVEN PICTURE IS CONVERTED INTO GRAYSCALE IMAGE FOR BETTER PERFORMANCE.

4> CascadeClassifier IS USED TO IMPORT THE REQUIRED “haarcascade_face.xml” FILE


5>detectMultiScale FUNCTION IS PASSED TO FIND OUT THE COORDINATES OF THE PLACES WHERE FACE IS LOCATED.


6>A for LOOP IS USED TO EXTRACT ALL THE LIST OF COORDINATES AND USING THEM WE WILL CALL cv.rectangle FUNCTION TO DRAW A RECTANGLE OF THE SIZE AROUND THE FACE OF SAMPLE PICTURE SIGNIFYING THAT THE FACE IS DETECTED.


7>cv.WaitKey IS INVOKED TO SHOW THE OUTPUT FOR ENDLESS TIME UNTIL STOPPED. 


CONCLUSION:

FACE DETECTION IS A CRUCIAL TASK IN COMPUTER VISION, AND OPENCV SIMPLIFIES THE PROCESS WITH ITS PRE-TRAINED MODELS AND EXTENSIVE LIBRARY FUNCTIONS. THIS README PROVIDES A STARTING POINT FOR IMPLEMENTING FACE DETECTION USING OPENCV IN PYTHON. YOU CAN FURTHER CUSTOMIZE AND ENHANCE YOUR FACE DETECTION APPLICATION TO SUIT YOUR SPECIFIC NEEDS AND USE CASES.

2) REAL TIME USING WEB CAM 

FOR REALTIME FACE DETECTION ALL THE STEPS ARE SIMILAR
MOREOVER THE FUNCTION VideoCapture(0) 0 IS USED FOR ACCESSING WEB CAM 
ALL THE PROCEDURE FOR MULTISCALE DETECTION IS IMPORTED INTO A FUNCTION 
A while LOOP IS INVOKED WHEN THE RESULT IS True THEN IT WILL RECALL THE FUNCTION TO READ THE VIDEO FRAMES AND CONVERT THEM FOR FINDING THE FACE DETECTION .
HERE IS MY SAMPLE VIDEO ATTACHED AS DEMONSTRATION
